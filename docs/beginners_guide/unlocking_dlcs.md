# Unlocking DLCs
If you want to unlock DLCs for your games, you'll have to use CreamInstaller.

Once launched, it will automatically scan your Steam library and list all of your available games.

### 2. Choose the game you want DLCs for and click OK
After it's done caching, you’ll see a list of all available DLCs for your selected game.

### 3. Choose your desired DLCs from the list and click **Generate & Install**
Wait for the process to complete.

:::note
Your DLCs will **not** appear inside Steam. They will only show up in-game.

### Congrats!
If you've followed all of the steps correctly, you should now have the DLCs installed for your chosen game.
